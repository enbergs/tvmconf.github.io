# About

[Apache TVM(incubating)](https://tvm.apache.org/) is an open-source deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators.
It aims to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- or
efficiency-oriented hardware backends.

We are excited to announce the 2020 TVM Virtual Conference, December 2-4. The TVM Conference will cover the state of the
art of deep learning compilation optimization. We welcome TVM contributors, potential users, [UW SAMPL](http://sampl.ai)
sponsors, collaborators and researchers and practitioners from the broader community. The conference will discuss recent
advances in frameworks, compilers, systems and architecture support, security, training and hardware acceleration.
